This is a coding task repository for my IDP application 

## First Question - Two Sum
This was a question I solved before so I created a for loop and then looked for the complement item which adds up to the target with the current element in the loop. I used  the numTracker for more efficient lookups. I first solved the problem without it but then decided to create a map to decrease the time complexity.

## Second Question - Sorted Squared Array
For this one, I first solved the problem with nested loops which resulted in the O(n2) complexity, so I then decided to change my approach by using pointers. Using pointers and comparing squares on each iteration optimizes the code by eliminating the need to sort the entire array from scratch, or to create nested loops.
